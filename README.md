# Budget Tracker
Track your budget with or without internet connection.

## The Assignment
This application was a homework assignment for UW Full-Stack Bootcamp. The instructions for the assignment were to make a budget tracking app that allows the user to add desposits and subtract expenses from their budget both with and without an internet connection. Changes made while the user is offline should populate when the app is brought back online.

## The Process
The main goal for this project was to practice using IndexedDB for storing data in the browser and allow the user to still use the app while offline. We were provided the front-end code and also the routes for the assignment, but in order to make the app functional I had to add in the code for the database.

## The Outcome
My Budget Tracker allows the user to successfully update their budget while they are offline, and changes made offline will appear when the user opens the app again with an internet connection. The user can enter in a deposit and the amount will be added to the total budget, or enter a expense which will be subtracted from the budget. The total budget is displayed to the user and a graph is displayed below to give the user a visual of their deposits and expenses over time.
The app is deloyed on Heroku and can be found here: https://bootcamp-budget-tracker.herokuapp.com/
